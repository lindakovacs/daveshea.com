			<p>Hi, you’ve found my site. This is a collection of projects, pursuits, social media channels and whatever else I feel like putting on here.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on the web for the better part of two decades and never really had a proper home that linked all my various pursuits together. Sure there was the designy portfolio site from the dot com era that got converted over to a blog and saw a decent amount of <a href="/projects/mezzoblue/">success</a>.</p>

<p>Stuff about me in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proudly Canadian, I live in Vancouver.</li>
  <li>My background is in design; these days that means a lot more UX than UI, but I’ve produced my fair share of pixels over the years. I’ve always valued having one foot in the coding world, starting with Basic in the 90’s, progressing through PHP in the 2000’s, and now reaching for whatever language gets the job done. Lately that’s just been Jekyll &amp; Liquid templating, but has included <a href="/projects/elevation/">Processing</a> and <a href="/projects/paintbrush/">Javascript</a> in varying degrees. You can get a better picture on <a href="https://github.com/mezzoblue">Github</a> if you really want to dig in.</li>
  <li>I seem to <a href="/projects/wdn/">have</a> a <a href="/projects/style-class/">knack</a> for running <a href="/projects/farmhouse-fest/">events</a>.</li>
  <li>I’ve spoken at over 40 conferences in a dozen or so countries. Lanyrd has an incomplete listing of <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/mezzoblue/">past appearances</a>, fleshing that out is on the to-do list.</li>
  <li>There are at least two blogs around these parts: my <a href="http://beer.daveshea.com/">Beer Log</a> and a <a href="http://exnihilo.mezzoblue.com/">Processing sketch journal</a>.</li>
  <li>I ride a Look 585 and rack up a <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/941895">few thousand kilometers</a> each year. I’ve ridden the <a href="http://granfondowhistler.com/">Whistler Gran Fondo</a> three times now.</li>
  <li>I’ve fallen out of the habit of photo sharing, but I still have an extremely inactive <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/mezzoblue">Flickr</a> account and an only slightly less inactive <a href="http://instagram.com/mezzoblue">Instagram</a> feed.</li>
  <li>I prefer cooking from scratch when possible. Current favourite recipes include the <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/the-best-slow-cooked-italian-american-tomato-sauce-red-sauce-recipe.html">Serious Eats tomato sauce</a>, the pain de campagne from <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X">Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>, and Food Renegade’s <a href="http://www.foodrenegade.com/lactofermented-carrot-sticks/">lacto-fermented carrots</a>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- * something about <a href="http://brightcreative.com/portfolio/publications/">these publications</a> that I'll get around to writing eventually maybe

		<h2>The Story</h2>

		<p>This is brand new. So new in fact, that it&#8217;s still very much in progress. Follow along the development of this project at <a href="http://palatedeck.com/">The Palate Deck</a> site.</p>

		<p>In the meantime, here's how it works. The Palate Deck is a deck of Tasting Cards that encourage conversation and gameplay while sampling beer. You and up to 4 other people collaboratively select the cards that best describe what youâ€™re tasting. Many different play styles are supported: run a shared tasting session to build consensus, or prove your mettle by pitting your tasting ability against your friends.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s more than just a deck of cards though, it&#8217;s an in-depth tasting guide that provides similar flavors to help pinpoint a specific taste. It even lists some of the reasons <em>why</em> you&#8217;re experiencing a given flavor or sensation in a beer. Using the Palate Deck will help you improve your tasting perception and overall appreciation for the beer you're drinking &#8212; any beer!</p>

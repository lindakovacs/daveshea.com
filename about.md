Hi, I'm Dave Shea and you've found my site. This is a collection of projects, pursuits, social media channels and whatever else I feel like putting on here.

Stuff about me in no particular order:

* Proudly Canadian, I live in Vancouver.
* My background is in design; these days that means a lot more UX than UI, but I've produced my fair share of pixels over the years. I've always valued having one foot in the coding world too, starting with Basic in the 90's, progressing through PHP in the 2000's, and now reaching for whatever language gets the job done. Lately that's just been Jekyll & Liquid templating, but has included <a href="/projects/elevation/">Processing</a> and <a href="/projects/paintbrush/">Javascript</a> in varying degrees. You can get a better picture on <a href="https://github.com/mezzoblue">Github</a> if you really want to dig in.
* I seem to <a href="/projects/wdn/">have</a> a <a href="/projects/style-class/">knack</a> for running <a href="/projects/farmhouse-fest/">events</a>.
* I've spoken at over 40 conferences in a dozen or so countries. Lanyrd has an incomplete listing of <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/mezzoblue/">past appearances</a>, fleshing that out is on the to-do list.
* There are at least two blogs around these parts: my <a href="http://beer.daveshea.com/">Beer Log</a> and a <a href="http://exnihilo.mezzoblue.com/">Processing sketch journal</a>.
* I hold a few beer certifications. I'm a <a href="https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/users/dave-shea-0">Certified CiceroneÂ®</a>, I'm also a BJCP&#8211;certified beer judge. I actively judge at least a few competitions per year, mostly locally.
* My main ride is a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=look+585">Look 585</a> and I try to rack up a <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/941895">few thousand kilometers</a> each year. I rode the <a href="http://granfondowhistler.com/">Whistler Gran Fondo</a> three times.
* I've fallen out of the habit of photo sharing, but I still have an extremely inactive <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/mezzoblue">Flickr</a> account and an only slightly less inactive <a href="http://instagram.com/mezzoblue">Instagram</a> feed.
* I prefer cooking from scratch when possible. Current favourite recipes include the <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/the-best-slow-cooked-italian-american-tomato-sauce-red-sauce-recipe.html">Serious Eats tomato sauce</a>, the pain de campagne from <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X">Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>, and Food Renegade's <a href="http://www.foodrenegade.com/lactofermented-carrot-sticks/">lacto-fermented carrots</a>. I'm working hard on perfecting my home Neopolitan-style pizza. This has been slow going but delicious work.

<!-- * something about <a href="http://brightcreative.com/portfolio/publications/">these publications</a> that I'll get around to writing eventually maybe
